This project was created to give me some experience with parsing sequencing data, extracting gene ranges, and translating genes into proteins using several widely used bioinformatics packages in R (`Biostrings`, `rtracklayer`, `plyranges`. I chose Petunia axillaris because of my interest in horticultural breeding. For those who don't know, Petunias are a common crop grown in the floriculture industry and breeding efforts have been made to increase the value of the plant (ex: color morphology). 

NOTE: Sequencing data was obtained from NCBI's genome database in the FASTA format for genome. Gene annotations were obtained through Zenodo.com in the form of a gff file containing Petunia axillaris gene annotations v4.1 described in a paper "Identification of transcription factors controlling floral morphology in wild Petunia species with contrasting pollination syndromes" that was submitted to Plant Journal in August 2020. Links to the sources are provided in the R markdown file included in the repository.

The material was a very useful reference for me to learn basic bioinformatics programming methods. I am not affiliated with Thomas Girke and/or the University of California, Riverside.
